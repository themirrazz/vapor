# Vapor
#### a simple, easy to use Matrix client for Windows96

> **:warning: WARNING :warning:**<br>
> Vapor is no longer officially supported. We will not be disabling its functionality or taking it down, but it will no longer recieve updates.
> If you would still like to access Matrix on Windows 96, please look at my other repositories.

Welcome to the offical repo of Vapor, an easy-to-use Matrix Client for Windows96!

## How to install:
1. Download the latest version of Vapor.
2. Put in the "C:/user/bin" folder (create it if it isn't already there)
3. Make sure it is titled "vapor96" (at the time of writing).
4. Run "vapor96" either via the run box or terminal.

## Compatibility
This has been tested on different versions of Windows96.
* It will run on V2 and higher.
* It will NOT run on V1 and anything older.

## Auto-Update Checker
In order to get the latest version of Vapor, you do NOT need to reinstall it.
Vapor is equipped with an automatic update-checker that runs when you start the app,
and every 2 minutes until the window is closed.
A notification will appear if a software update is availible, and you will be able to update now or dismiss it until you close the app.

## 2.0.8 Offical Command List
Full list of upcoming commands in Vapor 2.0.8 (Pre-Release)
* `/me <text>` - Describe yourself.
* `/invite <userid>` - invite a user to the current room
* `/kick <userid>` - kick user from the current room
* `/ban <userid>` - ban user from the current room
* `/unban <userid>` - unban user from the current room
* `/upload <path>` - uploads and sends a file
* `/uploadimage <path>` - uploads and sends a file as an image
* `/call` - starts a voice call
* `/videocall` - starts a voice call and enables your camera
* `/plain <content>` - doesn't format your messagge
* `/html <content>` - sends HTML formatted content

## SSO: Why it's not in Vapor and why it won't be in 2.0.8
If you sign in to matrix via Google, Facebook, or anything else, you won't be able to log into your account on Vapor.
Here is a list of reasons why this won't work:

1. The trackers - right when you add SSO to your app, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook will start tracking you. We don't want to expose user data, and we don't sell users data because we don't even collect it. Unlike most services with SSO sign ins.
2. Google.com don't support iframes - Vapor is a Matrix Client for Windows 96, which is a website. It's default browser, Internet Exploder, is an iframe browser, meaning sites are embedded in iframes. Most major companies don't let their sites be embedded in iframes, specifically the login page.
3. APIs are huge - The Matrix API itself is already big enough - SSO APIs could make us unable to publish updates due to their size.

## Rumors: Stop-Motion Screen Sharing
Hopefully a feature coming out in 2.0.8, a 2.0.8 Patch, or (at the latest) 2.0.9, a new feature will be coming out (hopefully): screen sharing.
The difference: it shares only your Windows96 screen and audio (iframes don't render, video or audio) through matrix.

## Roadmap:
Here are Vapor features we are working on:
* Displaying Video Feeds - and Not Osciallating audio!
* the new and improved command system
* better security
* the next 2.0.8 WIP Version
* a bunch of new, fancy commands

## Known bug
The CurrentVersion JSON file is not formatted properly in some cases. When Updating to 2.0.7b, go to `C:/user/appdata/C:/user/appdata`, select "Vapor96", copy it, and paste it into `C:/user/appdata`
